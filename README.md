### General Information
**MaktAfri** is a web-based book application that provides book readers who enjoy African novels a platform to share their reads leave reviews on a particular book and also rate it. We identified that there was a scarcity of platforms where African book readers can share books they have read for others to see as well as leave reviews on how they find a particular book and rate it. Most of the reading apps for books contain all genres of books from all continents. However, having a single platform where African book readers can share books and leave reviews would ease the process of looking for African books to read in different book applications. MaktAfri web-based Book Application aims to fill this gap and to unite all  African book readers as a whole.
